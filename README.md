# ViewModel
## A new level of simplicity

ViewModel is a view layer for Meteor. You can think of it as Angular, Knockout, Aurelia, Vue, etc. but without the boilerplate code required to make those work.

[25/08/23] ViewModel package updated to work with current Meteor Blaze packages, teted upto 2.13

Here are some things it can do to make your life easier:

- [Less code to get things done][1]
- [State is automatically saved for you across hot code pushes][2]
- [Save the state on the url][3]
- [Components can be used as controls][4]
- [Share state between components][5]
- [Compose view elements via mixins][6]
- [Inline/scoped styles][7]
- [Better error messages][8]

Go to [viewmodel.org][9] for examples and full documentation.
